# New_Caffeine_Tracker
A revised version of the caffeine tracker I made in my junior year of highschool. This version has most things stripped down from the original project. Made using Unity UI and Google Firebase.

# Background
This was a project from my second semester of junior year coding class in highschool. GitHub shows Asp.net as the main language but it is actually made with C#.

I have chosen not to include some of the Unity and Firebase dependencies. The project was fun and a great learning experience. I used this project as a reason to experiment with Firebase and databases.

I was able to use the knowledge of UI I gained from this project for use in my senior year game development project.
